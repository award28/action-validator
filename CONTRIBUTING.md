# Environment Setup

## Install Rust
Firstly, you'll need make any changes to the core functionality of this project. We recommend use `rustup`, on the recommendation of the rust team. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

To confirm that rust is installed, run the `cargo` command. If you don't receive the help docs output, you may need to add rust to your shell rc file.
